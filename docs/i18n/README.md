# Documentation translations (i18n)

Luciuz documentation is written in **English first**.

This folder contains **community-maintained translations**.

## Languages
- **English (canonical)**: `docs/` (source of truth)
- **Français (WIP)**: `docs/i18n/fr/`

## Translation rules
- Keep file names identical to the English originals when possible.
- Prefer short, clear sentences.
- If a concept has no good translation, keep the English term and add a short explanation.
- If the English doc changes, translations may lag behind. That's OK.

## How to contribute a translation
1. Copy the English file you want to translate into your language folder.
2. Translate it.
3. Add a note at the top: `Last synced with: <commit or date>`.
